# Presentation git and VSCode


1. Show VSCode (once we move on to `git`, no more break).
2. Show `pytest` in VSCode, then in console.
3. Move on to `git`:
    1. Start by cloning a fork with HTTPS -- explain token.
    2. Explain git tree (slide would be helpful here).
    3. Create a branch for the work -> ask everyone if the branch is created.
    4. Explain `git status/diff` -> lifeline
    5. Show how to commit.
    6. Show how to push a branch and create a PR.
