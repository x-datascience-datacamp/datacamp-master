    "In binary classification we have two classes $\\{0, 1\\}$, often called Positive and Negative and we try to predict the class $y_i$ for each sample $X_i$. A simple example would be to try to predict whether a dog is present or not in a given image. In this case, the Positive class is the class of all photos of dogs and the Negative class includes all the other photos. The goal of the classifier is to predict, for each photo, if it is Positive (P) or Negative (N): is there a dog in the photo?\n",

It is created by plotting the fraction of true positives out of the positives (TPR = true positive rate) vs. the fraction of false positives out of the negatives (FPR = false positive rate), at various threshold settings. TPR is also known as sensitivity, and FPR is one minus the specificity or true negative rate.\n",

The curve represents the True Positive Rate as a function of the False Positive Rate when varying the decision threshold. In other words, for a decision threshold $\\alpha \\in [0, 1]$, the ROC curve compute the FPR and TPR of a classifier such that $f(X_i) = 1\\{p_i > \\alpha)$. A perfect classifier, for which there exist a value $\\alpha$ such that all negative samples have a score lower than $\\alpha$ and all positive samples have a score higher, would have a ROC curve which would be a step function.
